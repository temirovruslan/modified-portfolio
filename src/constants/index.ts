In this project, I learned how to fetch real-time data from the backend using server-sent events and connect it to individual users by their IDs. I also created charts using the Ant Charts library, and these charts would update as time passed. To build the UI, I used components from the Ant Design library and customized them to fit our requirements. Practicing Redux Toolkit for performing CRUD operations. We developed a weather app that fetched forecast data for specific locations and saved user's action history in their browser's storage. Additionally, I implemented sorting and filtering functionality. Worked with the Google Maps API to track user locations and movements. I worked together with designers and backend developers to improve the platform's features and capabilities. Platform was build using TypeScript.`,
