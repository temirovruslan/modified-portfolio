		description: `Our company began a new project from the beginning, and i build the platform from scratch as the only frontend developer. In this project, I learned how to fetch real-time data from the backend using server-sent events and connect it to individual users by their IDs. I also created charts using the Ant Charts library, and these charts would update as time passed. To build the UI, I used components from the Ant Design library and customized them to fit our requirements. For sate mangment was using Redux. We developed a weather app that fetched forecast data for specific locations and saved user's action history in their browser's storage. Additionally, I implemented sorting and filtering functionality. Worked with the Google Maps API to track user locations and movements. Platform was build using TypeScript.`,
